Notes:

1. It should essentially be a "blog-like", but have an about section, writers/editors, etc. Imagine like the News sites you see, but a tad more scientific.
2. Need to decide on what tools/tech to use. React? Node? Bootstrap?
3. Our task now is to build a super simple news site with nice looking UI.
